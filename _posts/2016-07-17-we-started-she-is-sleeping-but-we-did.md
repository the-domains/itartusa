Tiziano Calcari is one of the few artists who has felt the need to get out of the box to craft art with his imagination. The figure is voluntarily broken up, stretched-out, deformed and finally integrated in the landscape. Particularly interesting is his painting style, with big spots, where the light plays an important role. He possesses great expressive abilities and he is a valid painter able to stir up emotions with his art. They are interesting works to see as they reveal a personal style embellished by a fervent research. Tiziano Calcari has always been pushed forward by an emotional and creative drive to go beyond the limits of the figurative realism towards a more prominent attention for the expressionistic deformation of the real thing. Figures and landscapes have been the most recurrent themes of Calcari's work, in a career which he started as a self-taught artist and for many years pursued with great determination on the way towards experimentation and the assiduous research of his own expressive identity. Also in this last series of works figures and landscapes are back as actors in a scene where the main characters though are colors and shape. In the composition equilibrium of these paintings it is possible to notice the constant effort to obtain through chromatic and creative choices a general equilibrium in the distribution of space. In these works vivid shades and bright matching are predominant, while the purely graphic support tendentiously loses importance, as it is simply hinted at. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4415c906-8fb2-497d-9114-6f2d8ffda294.jpg)
