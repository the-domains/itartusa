Duina, E. Roberti, M. Zuppelli and Gil Alegrè. Since his childhood Calcari has always shown a serious disposition and passion for drawing and figurative arts. In 1990 he was introduced to the public by taking part in group exhibitions and contests, where he was repeatedly given awards by various juries and received important prizes and recognition by both the public and critics. He mastered the difficult watercolor technique, has got great sensitivity and imagination and he distinguishes himself in particular for the research he started through new figurative shapes and for the lyricism of his assumptions. His works can be found at different Italian and foreign collectors’ and his quotations are constantly increasing. He lives and works in Gardone V.T. (Brescia, Italy).</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/872577f5-4d86-4d82-a7c3-7759febad6a3.jpg" alt="" title=""><p>Tiziano Calcari is one of the few artists who has felt the need to get out of the box to craft art with his imagination. The figure is voluntarily broken up, stretched-out, deformed and finally integrated in the landscape. Particularly interesting is his painting style, with big spots, where the light plays an important role. He possesses great expressive abilities and he is a valid painter able to stir up emotions with his art. They are interesting works to see as they reveal a personal style embellished by a fervent research. Tiziano Calcari has always been pushed forward by an emotional and creative drive to go beyond the limits of the figurative realism towards a more prominent attention for the expressionistic deformation of the real thing. Figures and landscapes have been the most recurrent themes of Calcari’s work, in a career which he started as a self-taught artist and for many years pursued with great determination on the way towards experimentation and the assiduous research of his own expressive identity. Also in this last series of works figures and landscapes are back as actors in a scene where the main characters though are colors and shape. In the composition equilibrium of these paintings it is possible to notice the constant effort to obtain through chromatic and creative choices a general equilibrium in the distribution of space. In these works vivid shades and bright matching are predominant, while the purely graphic support tendentiously loses importance, as it is simply hinted at. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4415c906-8fb2-497d-9114-6f2d8ffda294.jpg" alt="" title=""></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="22"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="24"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="25"><span data-reactid="26"><!-- react-empty: 27 --><h2 data-reactid="28"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="29">Biography</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="30"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="32"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
